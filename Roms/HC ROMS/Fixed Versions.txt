- Fixed a bug that affects the controls of the two-player modes 81 - 96 in the second PAL release of the game: the shots alternate between the players, but the movement doesn’t - only the right player moves the cannon.

- Fixed the following bugs in the original version: 
1) Hold down the FIRE button and tap the joystick in any direction. When 2 seconds have elapsed, release the FIRE button: the bridge won’t blow up and you’re free to capture the criminals. 
2) Start the game and hold down the FIRE button when you are above the phone booth, then press SELECT and release the FIRE button. 
Wait for the screen to cycle 2 scenes over (to a subway entrance) and move towards the subway. 
The game will continue at that scene, but you won’t be able to fly up. 
If you go to the bridge scene, all the criminals will escape but the bridge will not blow up
